## Requirements

You must have a Java runtime installed on your machine. Install 'requirements.txt' in a virtual environment.

## Usage

We have built our chatbot to handle inputs/questions such as:
- Show me the ingredient list.
- What ingredients do I need?
- Where do I begin?
- What is the next step?
- What ingredients do I need for this step?
- What tools do I need for this step?
- What tools do I need for the recipe?
- What methods do I need for this step?
- How much *ingredient* do I need?
- Take me to the 4th step.
- What is the current step?
- Show me the previous step.
- Show me the steps list.
- What temperature?
- How long?
- How do I preheat the oven?
- What can I use instead of oil?

The chatbot is also able to handle many variations of these questions.
We also finish the optional part of ingredient and method based on key word list and NLTK.
